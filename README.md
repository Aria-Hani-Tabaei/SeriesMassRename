It's important to note that firstly it's not a project.
I can name this just a 5 minute code writing to tackle down an obstacle on my way.
I was watching a series and I downloaded two different encodings of this movie.
Therefore the names were as described bellow:
1.  The_Mentalist_S01E02_720p_BluRay_PaHE
2.  The.Mentalist.S04E14.720p.AMZN.WEB.DL.x265.HET
You can see that the first on Even though an earlier episode is spaced using an underscore (_)
Therefore, the default sorting system of Windows sorts my episodes based on Every Character
And the earlier episode end up at the end of my directory.
So I decided to write a code to invert every underscore with dote using python so that it sorts it based on the episodes.
It is a fairly easy task

just need to add a few libraries 
the sleep function however is intended for me to be able to watch the directory as it is doing its job.
